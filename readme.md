## About this repository

Repository itself is a fork of the course assignments tasks,
but it has been modified for improving my own development experience.

### Style modifications

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) settings for improving text editing.
- Tabs instead of spaces, because tabs are more accessible
  to people who use screen readers.
- CSS structure with more recent CSS features:
  - "Sass-styled" code structure (without external tools!)
  - [Cascade layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers)
    enable more accurate handling of the cascade order of the elements.
    - There is also a [good tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/css-cascade-layers/)
      about cascade layers on _CSS Tricks_ website.
